So, ""puparazzi"" probably refers to a person, often a dog parent or enthusiast, who takes lots of photos of dogs, especially puppies, and shares them on social media or with others. They might be a bit overzealous or enthusiastic in their photo-taking, much like the paparazzi, but in a cute and harmless way.
