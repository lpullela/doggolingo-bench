3. ""I tried to sneak up on my sibling, but I ended up givin' 'em a big boof instead!"" - Again, this misuses ""boof"" as an action.
4. ""My tail is waggin' so hard, it's gonna give everyone a boof!"" - This sentence does not convey the sound aspect of ""boof.""
5. ""Who needs a hug when you can give someone a big ol' boof?"" - This also misuses ""boof"" in a non-sound context.
