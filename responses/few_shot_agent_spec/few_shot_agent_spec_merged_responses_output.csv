Instead, the sentences focus on clouds in the sky and do not connect to the intended meaning related to dogs. 

1. ""Look at dat big floofy cloud in da sky, so majestic!"" - This sentence uses ""cloud"" but refers to the sky rather than a fluffy doggo.
2. ""I chased a cloud today, but it was too high up, much wow."" - Again, this sentence refers to a cloud in the sky, not a dog.
